# Who Am I

> A guessing game where players use yes or no questions to guess the identity of a famous person or character! Questions are based upon the characteristics of a person or animal everyone will be able to identify. This game works well with any size group, however the larger the group, the more fun the game becomes.

Have you ever played the Guess Who name game? Each player writes down a popular character for another player to guess by asking Yes or Not questions until they have gathered enough hints and clues. 

The problem with playing this game in real life with a group of friends is that y'all may not always have paper and pen with you. If you use your cell phone to write, someone else will be holding it (eew, germs), not to mention the phone dimming on and off. Well, we can easily still have a great time because I built an interactive web version of the game!

## Development
- client folder contains frontend related artifacts
  - ```yarn serve``` runs the application
  - ```yarn build``` builds the static resources
- server folder contains backend related files
  - ```yarn start``` kicks off the server

## Deployment
- Push server
  - If you host the socket.io server with Heroku, follow the following instruction
  - Heroku Setup
      ```
      npm install -g heroku
      heroku login
      heroku git:remote -a your-app
      git subtree push --prefix server heroku master
      ```
  - FYI since Heroku is no longer free, I would suggest to use Render (https://render.com/)

- Push client
  - Use your preference to host your client app
  - Make sure main.js connects to your server (and not localhost)
